                When's the last time you've had an Italian soda? It had been a while for me,
                but I wanted to join my friend for a non-caffeinated beverage at Bytes and I
                became reaquainted with the combination of fizzy water and artificial fruit syrup.
                Italian sodas are not so sweet as a normal soda and not so boring as a flavored
                carbonated water. The Italian sodas at Bytes also have no cream in them (or maybe
                they do if you ask; I haven't tried), which makes it a nice coffee shop alternative
                for the times when you're feeling a refreshing drink that doesn't have caffeine or milk.

                  When your boba craving strikes, head over to Pop Tea Bar, a cute little bubble tea shop
                  on Cambridge Avenue. The menu is your standard bubble tea fare with nothing too
                  adventurous on the menu -- no bubble tea floats, for example -- but the tapioca is
                  fresh, the service is fast, and the tea is smooth and delicious! They have little bites
                  to eat too, like popcorn chicken and eggrolls, in perfect snack-size portions. There's
                  not too much seating, but there's a cute outdoor area in the back for warmer days.

                  Pop Tea Bar isn't exactly on campus, but the Marguerite has got you covered. Ride the
                  1050A to California and El Camino and it's a short walk from there. (11 minutes total
                  from the Gates Computer Science Building!)

                  I can't tell you whether CoHo has a particularly amazing Vanilla Bean Latte, only
                  because CoHo is the only place I've ever ordered a Vanilla Bean Latte from. I'm not
                  even totally sure I know what a Vanilla Bean Latte is supposed to taste like. What I
                  do know is the Vanilla Bean Latte I ordered on a whim from CoHo was delicious.

                  Nexus Cafe has a lot of tasty things packed into its cafeteria space, including agua
                  fresca! Grab a cup of this fresh and fruity beverage before you head to the check out
                  line. Nexus Cafe has plenty of indoor and outdoor seating, too, so on the next sunny
                  day, take a break on the patio with a cup of agua fresca, and maybe a burrito.
